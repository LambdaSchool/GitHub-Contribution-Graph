# UPDATE

We recommend against de-forking while in class - just so all the links submitted stay active. But, you don't really need to de-fork anything.

All the commit history lives in the `.git` folder in the local Git repo directory - you just need to get the project up to GitHub. This can be as simple as:

1. creating a new repo on GitHub,
2. giving it a unique name to help distinguish it in your GitHub repository list, and
3. pushing the project up to the new GitHub repository.

It might help to make a "Team" to keep the "active student" repositories separate from the ones pushed up for the heatmap.

### Please take a moment to review GitHub's "[Learn How We Count Contributions](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile)" page. In particular the "[Commit Was Made In A Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/#commit-was-made-in-a-fork)" section. If you'd like all of your work to be reflected on your GitHub Contribution Graph, you can do the following:

# "De-Forking" Your Project

1. **DO NOT DELETE YOUR LOCAL PROJECT!**
2. If you want your new and "non-forked" GitHub project name to match the old project name, first [rename](#how-to-rename-your-old-github-repo) or [delete](#how-to-delete-your-old-github-repo) your forked GitHub repository. Do this _**on**_ GitHub. You can access the renaming and deleting options on GitHub in the "Settings" tab of your fork. Don't worry, if you delete your GitHub fork, your local copy will be safe.
3. Create a new empty repository on GitHub. You are welcome to name it whatever makes sense to you. If you have renamed or deleted the old one, you can give it the same name of the original Lambda School project you are "de-forking" from.

![CREATE the new repository](img/create-new-repository.png)
![COPY the new repository's URL](img/copy-new-repo-URL.png)

4. Add the new (and empty) GitHub repository as the "origin" remote to your local git repository.

```console
$  git remote -v
   origin  https://github.com/LambdaSchool-PairStudentA/Preprocessing-I.git (fetch) <--- OLD ORIGIN URL
   origin  https://github.com/LambdaSchool-PairStudentA/Preprocessing-I.git (push) <---- OLD ORIGIN URL
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
$  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mixelpixel/Preprocessing-I.git <-------- SET NEW ORIGIN URL
$  git remote -v
   origin  https://github.com/mixelpixel/Preprocessing-I.git (fetch) <------------------ VERIFY NEW ORIGIN URL
   origin  https://github.com/mixelpixel/Preprocessing-I.git (push) >------------------- VERIFY NEW ORIGIN URL
                              ^^^^^^^^^^
```

5. Push your local project to the new GitHub repository.

```console
$  git push origin master
